# app features:

the app has 2 routes:
-list view(/characters) => show the list of persons
-detail view(/characters/${id}) => user can edit the person from this route

usage of CRUD operations:
- Create -> Add button - show a popup and insert details into each field, if URL is set correctly as it comes from json the image will be displayed too at card creation
- Read   -> show list of 30 people from GOT (used a free api from GOT series)
- Update -> Edit cards (the image cannot be updated yet, but you can add another card with same inputs and that specific image that must have been updated)
- Delete -> Delete an individual card 

*in order for the things to actually work you need to run npm i from both backend and frontend and then start by:
json-server --watch db.json
and 'npm run start'
have fun!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
